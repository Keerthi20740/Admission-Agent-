🧩 How Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Works

🔹 Retrieval

1. User's question is embedded into a vector representation


2. The system searches a vector database or IBM Watson Discovery


3. The most relevant documents are retrieved



🔹 Augmentation

The retrieved content (e.g., PDF text, webpage data) is combined with the prompt before generating the answer.

🔹 Generation

IBM Granite uses the augmented prompt to generate a natural language response that's backed by real data.
